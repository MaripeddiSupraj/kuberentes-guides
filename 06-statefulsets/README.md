# StatefulSets - Stateful Applications

StatefulSets manage stateful applications with stable network identities and persistent storage.

## Learning Path

### [01-basic](./01-basic/) - StatefulSet Fundamentals
- Creating StatefulSets
- Stable network identities
- Ordered deployment and scaling
- Persistent volume claims

### [02-intermediate](./02-intermediate/) - Stateful Application Patterns
- Database deployments
- Headless services
- Update strategies
- Storage management

### [03-advanced](./03-advanced/) - Enterprise Stateful Patterns
- Multi-master databases
- Cross-zone replication
- Backup and restore strategies
- Custom stateful operators

## Key Features

- **Stable Pod names** - Predictable naming (pod-0, pod-1, etc.)
- **Stable network IDs** - Consistent DNS names
- **Ordered operations** - Sequential deployment/scaling
- **Persistent storage** - Automatic PVC creation
